## Pushbullet Stuff

These scripts send pushbullet notifications, I use this mostly so I can use my tablet as a second small monitor, via [spacedesk](https://www.spacedesk.net/)  
I use this for stuff like spotify etc  
The notifications are received by [Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/), which logs in (manually by pressing the keys lol), then starts spacedesk  
`Push bullet on pc start.flo` is this script. It can be imported but will have to be changed for different devices  
`remove spacedesk popup.ahk` removes the popup that shows when a device connects.
